📊 HR Analytics Dashboard – Power BI Project

This repository contains my HR Analytics Dashboard, built using Power BI to analyze workforce trends, employee attrition, job satisfaction, and key HR performance indicators.
The goal of this project is to enable data-driven decision-making for HR teams by providing clear, interactive insights.

🚀 Project Overview

The HR Analytics Dashboard helps answer critical HR questions such as:

What is the overall attrition rate?

Which departments have the highest attrition?

How is the workforce distributed by age and gender?

What does job satisfaction look like across different roles?

Which age groups and genders are most affected by attrition?

This dashboard provides a complete view of employee data for better workforce planning and retention strategies.
